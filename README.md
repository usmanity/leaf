# Leaf
A theme for wordpress blogs. 
This theme is intended for blogs that are text heavy with images used sparingly. 
Don't use this theme if you have a photography blog or an image heavy blog. 


## Downloads

See [releases](https://github.com/usmanity/leaf/releases) for latest version to download.


## What it contains
This theme encourages a single pane view (no sidebars, no hamburger menus, and no popups). 
Dark mode is enabled by default (uses the system's dark mode settings to switch over).

## Versioning

This project does not use a strict SemVer since it's not a tool or library, it's mostly
visual and each version includes adjustments, fixes, and removes mainly broken
things. The version number should be correlated with the visual style more than
what's in the code. The expectation is that you see which version contains the
style you like and use that version. 

I update the version any single day I work on the theme. For example, when I 
worked on the theme for the day of Saturday Feb 15th, 2020, the version was 1.5,
any release on that day including bug fixes, would just live under 1.5.x. This way
I am not tied to a strict versioning system. Major versions will just happen when
the minor reaches x.9.
